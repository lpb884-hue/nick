<em> There's a loving in your eyes all the way
If I listened to your lies would you say </em>

<div> I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go
You come and go </div>

You come and go
You come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream
Red, gold and green
Red, gold and green <p>

<p> Didn't hear your wicked words every day
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say <p>

<br> That my love was an addiction
When we cling our love is strong
When you go you're gone forever
You string along
You string along <br>

Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream

<p> Every day is like survival
You're my lover not my rival
Every day is like survival
You're my lover not my rival <p>

<p> I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go
You come and go <p>
